### Transforming Cooking with AI: Recipe Generation from Ingredients and Images

In today's fast-paced world, finding the perfect recipe for the ingredients you have on hand can be a challenge. Our innovative project aims to solve this problem by integrating advanced AI technologies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Meta Llama2, to generate recipes from both ingredient lists and images.

At its core, this project employs CNNs to recognize ingredients from images, a crucial first step in the recipe generation process. Once the ingredients are identified, the Meta Llama2 language model takes over, crafting comprehensive and coherent recipes. This seamless integration of image recognition and text generation showcases the power of AI in simplifying everyday tasks.

The project is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to either type in their ingredients or upload images of them. The server, powered by Flask and hosted on Google Colab, processes these inputs, running the CNN model for image recognition and the Llama2 model for recipe generation. The generated recipes are then continuously updated and displayed to the user, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.

By making cooking more accessible and personalized, our project not only inspires culinary creativity but also demonstrates the potential of AI in transforming everyday activities. Whether you're a novice cook or a seasoned chef, this tool promises to turn your kitchen into a hub of innovation and flavor.
