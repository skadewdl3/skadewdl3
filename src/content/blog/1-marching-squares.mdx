In the world of computer graphics and game development, an algorithm that comes up often is Marching Squares.
Quadtrees are also used often in the same fields, to optimize spatial queries. These two contents
are fundamental for terrain generation, collision detection, and more.

This post aims to provide an understanding of these algorithms with interactive examples,
their implementation in Typescript (using [p5.js](https://processing.org)) for the use case of
graphing implicit functions.

## Contouring

Marching Squares is a computer graphics algorithm used for contouring in two-dimensional scalar fields. It's often used in terrain generation in games, where it helps create more realistic and complex landscapes.

The algorithm works by dividing the terrain into a grid of squares. Each corner of a square is assigned a value based on the height of the terrain at that point. The algorithm then determines where the contour line should pass through the square, creating a more detailed and realistic terrain.

```typescript
const marchingSquares = () => {
  console.log('Marching Squares');
}
```

## Quadtrees

Quadtrees, on the other hand, are a tree data structure used in computer graphics and game development for spatial partitioning. They're often used for collision detection, where they help determine which objects might collide without having to check every single object.

The algorithm works by dividing the space into four quadrants. Each quadrant can be further divided into four smaller quadrants, and so on. This creates a tree structure where each node represents a quadrant of space, making it easier to check for potential collisions.

```python
# Pseudocode for Quadtrees
def quadtree(space):
    divide space into quadrants
    for each quadrant:
        if quadrant contains more than one object:
            quadtree(quadrant)
```

## Conclusion

Marching Squares and Quadtrees are powerful tools in computer graphics and game development. Understanding these algorithms and how they work together can help you create more complex and efficient games. So, start experimenting with these algorithms and see what you can create!
